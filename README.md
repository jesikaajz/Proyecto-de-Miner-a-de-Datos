# 🌍 Severity Classification of Migration Incidents

## 📌 Project Description

This project builds a complete Machine Learning pipeline to classify the severity of migration-related incidents using the **Global Missing Migrants Dataset**.

The goal is to predict the severity level of an incident (`Low`, `Medium`, `High`) based on geographical, temporal, and contextual features.

The project includes:

- 📊 Data Understanding
- 🧹 Robust Data Cleaning
- 🎯 Target Variable Creation
- 🚫 Data Leakage Prevention
- ✂️ Stratified Train/Test Split
- 🧠 Training and comparison of multiple ML models
- 📈 Advanced statistical evaluation

---

## 🗂 Dataset

The dataset contains historical information about migration incidents, including:

- Number of deaths
- Estimated number of missing persons
- Region of incident
- Year
- Cause of death
- Geographic coordinates

Original target variable:

Total Number of Dead and Missing

---

## 🎯 Target Variable Creation

The problem is transformed into a multiclass classification task:

| Total Dead & Missing | Severity |
|----------------------|----------|
| 0 – 2                | Low      |
| 3 – 10               | Medium   |
| > 10                 | High     |

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning

Includes:

- Duplicate removal
- Safe numeric conversion
- Negative value correction
- Coordinate parsing and validation
- Total reconstruction consistency checks
- Removal of inconsistent records

---

## 🔐 Leakage Removal

The following columns are removed to prevent target leakage:

- Total Number of Dead and Missing
- Number of Dead
- Minimum Estimated Number of Missing
- Number of Survivors
- Number of Females
- Number of Males
- Number of Children

---

## ✂️ Train/Test Split

- 80% Training
- 20% Testing
- Stratified by class
- Academic validation of split strategy

---

## ⚙️ Preprocessing

- Leakage-free imputation (median/mode from training set)
- Cardinality reduction
- Outlier treatment
- OneHot Encoding
- Feature scaling (for linear/distance models)
- Feature selection (SelectKBest)

---

## 🤖 Models Trained

- KNN
- SVM (Linear, Polynomial, RBF)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Extra Trees
- AdaBoost
- Bagging

Hyperparameter tuning performed using GridSearchCV with:

F1-weighted as optimization metric.

## 📊 Final Results

| Model          | Accuracy | F1-weighted |
|---------------|----------|------------|
| SVM           | 0.808    | 0.7848     |
| Random Forest | 0.806    | 0.7900     |
| Extra Trees   | 0.792    | 0.7827     |
| AdaBoost      | 0.801    | 0.7632     |
| Decision Tree | 0.767    | 0.7667     |
| KNN           | 0.727    | 0.7520     |
| Naive Bayes   | 0.583    | 0.6426     |

Random Forest and SVM show the most stable and competitive performance.
